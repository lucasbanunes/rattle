# rattle
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae), the _Pythonidae_ is a family of nonvenomous snakes that "constrict their prey to suffocate it prior to consumption". This is a contrast with the usual thought of venomous snakes with their useful rattle working as a tool to alert nearby animals.

This repo tries to fix this problem by implementing some useful functions and other utils for the python language so it can make itself more useful with faster developing times.
