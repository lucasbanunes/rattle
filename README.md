# rattle
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae), the _Pythonidae_ is a family of nonvenomous snakes that "constrict their prey to suffocate it prior to consumption". This is a contrast with the usual thought of venomous snakes with their useful rattle working as a tool to alert nearby animals.

This repo tries to fix this problem giving our python its own rattle. It aims to implement some misc functions and other utils for faster developing times.
